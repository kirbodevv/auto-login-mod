# Auto Login Mod

> This Minecraft mod lets you log into your server account with a simple shortcut. I created it because typing my password every time I joined a server on the [Steam Deck](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck/) was pretty inconvenient.

> [!WARNING]
> At this time, passwords are stored in plain text. Please use with caution and avoid sharing your configuration file.

## Features

- **Auto Login**: Automatically executes the `/login %your_password%` command when you click `F9` (or your chosen shortcut).
- **Customizable Shortcut**: Set your own key combination to trigger the auto-login.
- ~~**Secure Storage**: Passwords are stored securely using encryption.~~
